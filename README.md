CSS Media Queries, Size Matters, October 2012
==============================================
I created a responsive web page to demonstrate how CSS Media Queries can be used to change media based on each unique viewer's different screen sized.  I did not focus on specific devices, because it seems more efficient to focus on the actual screen size instead of redundant CSS for iPad, iPhone, BlackBerry, and Thousands of Devices.

If this project inspires you to create your own responsive website, please send a link to me and we can do a friendly link exchange.
